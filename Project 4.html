                        <p>
                     Asa and I worked together on this project! We started by scaling the files by 150% in prusaslicer, using no supports when printing.
<p>
</p>
We divided the work based on availability -- Asa had to miss a few classes for the holidays, and I slept through one. As a result, I printed most of the hand, then he assembled the majority of it, leaving the last 2 fingers for me to string on and attach the tensioner pin for. Printing it was a bit of a pain. I initially tried to print it in the makerlab, but it kept failing, so I went to office hours instead. I thought that the assembly process wasn’t too bad - there were a solid number of pretty comprehensive guides online, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXoVSTgzyec">&lt;this one></a>, and I found one which which was a whole hour and a half long.
 

                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Here are some of the photos of the finished hand: 
</p>

<a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/5 hand.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
<span class="caption text-muted">(I realized after I uploaded these that these photos are from before I added the finger covers! Oops!! You can see them later on, though!)

</p>
</p>
<p>


Thinking about modifications was interesting. I started by trying to use the hand for a variety of things - turning pages, drinking water, writing. I figured that as I wasn’t able to consult someone who had an upper limb difference, simulating the use of the product myself was the least I could do.


</p>

<p>
Initially, I considered adding some type of hole where you could insert a writing utensil and tried to think of a few potential mechanisms to hold it in place.  I knew that I wanted to add something which blended into the form nicely rather than being a separate attachment which stuck out from the body. I identified a few places where there seemed to be unused space, and this was a potential. The reason I had been trying to find a place to insert a pen rather than just gripping it with the hand was that it seemed like it would be easier to control a writing utensil closer to the body, rather than extended further away. But, after thinking about different places one could place a pencil, I realized that just holding it with the hand seemed easier. 


</p>
<p>
Except for one major problem. The pen kept slipping! I didn’t think that it was because of the grip of the fingers, which seemed fine. Instead, I identified the issue to be the palm - totally smooth and flat, it was entirely unable to hold onto anything.



</p>

<p>
I thought that there would be 2 things which could help with this: squish and grip. Only a small amount of the surface area of the pen were in contact with the palm, making it much slippier, too unstable to write with. If one could increase the softness of the palm such that one could squish the pen into it, it would be a lot more stable. In addition, increasing the friction of the surface would help - the smooth PLA had very little friction. 


</p>
<p>
Specifically, I think it would make sense to use a similar grip tape to the one that my contact staff uses. It’s squishy, going about as far out as my final sketches show, and it’s also relatively grippy. It’s not outright rubbery, but feels similar to a human palm. Here is a (rather low res) image of it:
</p>
<p>
   <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/5 foam.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
   
</p> 
<p>

I quickly tested the squish idea by putting my sweatshirt on the palm and writing with the pen between the thumb and palm with the sweatshirt layer. This partially tested increasing friction, as the friction of this material is higher than that of smooth plastic, but it didn’t have nearly as much friction as would have been possible with proper grip. Instead, this mostly tested squish, increasing the surface area in contact with the pen! Lo and behold, it was drastically easier to write with! See the following images:
 

   <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/5 sweatshirt.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
   <p><a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/5 handwriting.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
<span class="caption text-muted">

</p> 

<p>
The contrast is striking - while my handwriting isn’t great in any case, there is a large improvement between using the typical palm and using the sweatshirt as a buffer! You can write darker and with much more control. :D 
</p>
<p>

So, I sketched out my solution on paper and in CAD like so:

<p>
It was fun messing around with this. :)
