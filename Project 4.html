                        <p>
                     Asa and I worked together on this project! We started by scaling the files by 150% in prusaslicer, using no supports when printing. Alas, I don't have any photos of the settings, but we set it to 30-40% infill! 
<p>
</p>
We divided the work based on availability -- Asa had to miss a few classes for the holidays, and I slept through one. As a result, I printed most of the hand, then he assembled the majority of it, leaving the last 2 fingers for me to string on and attach the tensioner pin for. Printing it was a bit of a pain. I initially tried to print it in the makerlab, but it kept failing, so I went to office hours instead. I thought that the assembly process wasn’t too bad - there were a solid number of pretty comprehensive guides online, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXoVSTgzyec">&lt;this one></a>, and I found one which which was a whole hour and a half long.
 

                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Here are some of the photos of the finished hand:

</p>
</p>
<p>


Thinking about modifications was interesting. I started by trying to use the hand for a variety of things - turning pages, drinking water, writing. I figured that as I wasn’t able to consult someone who had an upper limb difference, simulating the use of the product myself was the least I could do.


</p>

<p>
Initially, I considered adding some type of hole where you could insert a writing utensil and tried to think of a few potential mechanisms to hold it in place.  I knew that I wanted to add something which blended into the form nicely rather than being a separate attachment which stuck out from the body. I identified a few places where there seemed to be unused space, and a pen sticking through the hand's body wouldn't be problematic. This seemed potentially promising - this solution wouldn't stick out. The reason I had been trying to find a place to insert a pen rather than just gripping it with the hand was that it seemed like it would be easier to control a writing utensil closer to the body, rather than extended further away, and it seemed like there were some good places where this was possible near the base of the palm. But, after thinking about different places one could place a pencil, I realized that just holding it with the hand was likely easier.   


</p>
<p>
Except for one major problem. The pen kept slipping! I didn’t think that it was because of the grip of the fingers, which seemed fine. Instead, I identified the issue to be the palm - totally smooth and flat, it was very challenging to hold onto small things.



</p>

<p>
I thought of 2 things to help with this: squish and grip. Only a small amount of the surface area of the pen were in contact with the palm, as it was very hard, making it much slippier and too unstable to write with. If one could increase the softness of the palm such that one could squish the pen into it, it would be a lot more stable. In addition, increasing the friction of the surface would help - the smooth PLA had very little friction. 
  

</p>
<p>
Specifically, I think it would make sense to use a similar grip tape to the one that my contact staff uses. It’s squishy, going about as far out as my final sketches show, and it’s also relatively grippy. It’s not outright rubbery, but feels similar to a human palm. Here is a (rather low res) image of it:
</p>
<p>
   <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/5 foam.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
        <span class="caption text-muted">Staff :)
</p> 
<p>

I quickly tested the squish idea by putting my sweatshirt on the palm and writing with the pen between the thumb and palm with the sweatshirt layer. This partially increased friction, as the friction of this material is higher than that of smooth plastic, but it didn’t have nearly as much friction as would have been possible with proper grip. So, it mainly tested squish, increasing the surface area in contact with the pen! Lo and behold, it was drastically easier to write with! See the following images:
 <p></p>

   <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/5 sweatshirt.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
     <span class="caption text-muted">Sweatshirt simple prototype 
   <p><a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/5 handwriting.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
<span class="caption text-muted">
      <span class="caption text-muted">Woahhh it worked :)) 

</p> 

<p>
The contrast is striking - while my handwriting isn’t great in any case, there is a large improvement between using the typical palm and using the sweatshirt as a buffer! You can write darker and with much more control. :D  
</p>
<p>

So, I sketched out my solution on paper and in CAD like so:

  <span class="caption text-muted">Sketch and final model!

While useful for writing, the great thing about this modification is that it's generalizable, which is why I finally settled on it! I think this modification would benefit the user experience in handling many different types of objects. One potential issue is that it would trap too much heat -- I assume that this is the reason for the holes on the bottom -- but hopefully, creating holes in the foam could alleviate that issue.    
</p>

<P>
I think it isn't a great solution for writing for a long period of time - there are more minimal prostheses that could likely do this with less strain (Hendren talked about specialized, relatively cheap prostheses aimed towards this). But, this makes it an option, if one cannot write with their other hand. Rather than changing prostheses or having to think much at all, one can now fluidly grab a pen and write a quick note much easier than before. 
</P>
<p>
I remember Hendren discussing the role of prostheses in everyday life. She mentioned one woman's experience, where her incredibly expensive prosthetic arm was left unused, as it simply didn't suit her needs. As Hendren wrote, "In its attempt to mimic all handlike tasks, at least theoretically, it ended up fitting none precisely enough." I worry about this in the Phoenix V3 Hand. It just.. looks so much like a full hand. And I'm skeptical that what appears to be a typical hand is an especially well functioning form for a prosthetic hand. It’s aiming to look close to a typical hand while also being as functional as possible. I wonder what sacrifices there might be in favor of looking "normal."   
</p><p>
All in all, this was an interesting exercise in thinking about design justice. We didn’t have anyone with upper limb differences to give input, so we wound up just thinking about it all ourselves, kinda the opposite as to what we’ve discussed in class. I think that because we didn’t have input from someone consistently using this, we likely missed a lot of low-hanging fruit for how to improve its functionality and comfort. But, it was fun messing around with this. I think the readings and this project will definitely inform how I think about disability and how humans interface with the world. :)
