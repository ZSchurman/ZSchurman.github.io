<h2 class="section-heading">1. Evidence of design for navigation without one or more of the 5 senses</h2>
                   <p>
					<a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/1.1yellow.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
					</p>

<p>
These panels are used so that the blind can navigate across crosswalks (as well as being placed in dangerous public spaces like train stations). Canes can detect the textured surfaces, and the panels are generally yellow to be visible for those with low vision. These are apparently called detectable warning surfaces! 

</p>
<p>
					<a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/1.2noisy.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
					</p>
<p>
This light makes noises to alert those with vision impairments to where the crosswalk was! I hadn't noticed it before the day of the scavenger hunt.
</p>
<h2 class="section-heading">2. Evidence of design for forms of assistance, broadly defined</h2>
                   <p>
					<a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/2allergy.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
					
</p>
<p>
For this category, I chose to highlight the infrastructure designed to support those with alternative dietary needs. I chose this because it’s an important part of making campus accessible to me! I can’t eat gluten (as well as many other foods), and many of my friends have similar needs. Beyond the existence of food aimed to support these needs, the same symbols are used to denote allergens and related ideas across all food places on campus, making it easier to navigate. 
</p>


<h2 class="section-heading">3. Evidence of design for aging, broadly defined</h2>
                   <p>
					<a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/4.3.1 button.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
					<p>
						Here, I chose to highlight the accessibility buttons which open doors! These buttons allow people with limited strength, reduced dexterity, or mobility aids, like wheelchairs or walkers, to enter spaces more easily. This often applies to older folks, but, it also works for people of all ages with temporary injuries, or those carrying heavy items or pushing strollers.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">4. Evidence of design for young children</h2>
                   <p>
					<a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/4.4.3 baby changing.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
					<p>
						This is the most obvious example of design for young children! Though perhaps it is better explained as design oriented towards people with young children. It’s pretty self explanatory - a changing station, found in the Mandel Center for Studies in Jewish Education.
</p>
                   <p>
					<a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/4.4.1 pencil.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
				
				<p>
				I may have been a bit biased to include this, as it is my new favorite pencil and I am very excited to show it off. It has some lil Lisa Frank spider designs, with a large eraser glued on. The bright and silly design seemed to be oriented towards children. This can actually be helpful to get kids excited about learning or making art, for the sake of using their new special pencil! One could make the claim that the large eraser is better for young kids, as it’s easier to grip and control, and useful for young kids working on their motor skills. But, honestly, while I think it does count as an example of design for young kids, I don’t think it’s an example of a good one. It’s very top heavy, which throws me off a bit - I think that it would likely wreak havoc on a little kid's handwriting, they would likely get tired of that sensation rather quickly.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">5. Evidence of design for wheeled mobile gear</h2>
                   <p>
					<a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/4.5.1 fountain.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
					</p>
					<p>Here, I selected the lowered water fountains! Their height makes it more comfortable for users of wheeled mobility devices to reach it more easily. I also noticed that it had a bigger button to push than many that I’ve seen, which may have been an intentional choice to make it easier for any person.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">6. Evidence of design with physical barriers</h2>
                   <p>
					<a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/4.6.1 hallway.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
					<p>
						For this, we selected the thin hallways in East, as Hannah said that they were designed to be riot proof, which would make sense, given the experience of being in them. I couldn’t find any evidence of this claim online. But, it was built in 1964, so it would definitely line up.
</p>
<p>
I did find this very reputable reddit thread <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/sotr4h/riotproof_college_campus_buildings/">reddit thread</a> with an alternative explanation, rooted in the brutalist architecture which had been exploding in popularity at the time:
“Brutalists favored complex circulation within their buildings, with the aim of fostering community. Exterior walls of load-bearing concrete permitted the creation of intricately designed interior spaces. Labyrinthine hallways, interior atriums, catwalks, and mezzanines, which were intended to add visual interest and spatial complexity, fed the rumors of the creation of an architecture of manipulation and control, leading to the creation of the “riot-proof” building myth.”
</p>
<p>
Another <a href="http://bulletin-archive.kenyon.edu/x3212.html/">source</a> expands on this with the idea that “the kinks in the halls are meant to define "neighborhoods" of nine dorm rooms, a strategy to "humanize" a large dorm building, as Rohlfing put it.”
</p>
<p>
This is compelling to me, though I wouldn’t be surprised if the movements of the time also had an impact on the trend.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">7. Evidence of design with a lack of information</h2>
                   <p>
					<a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/4.7.1pantry.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
					
					<p>
						Here, we selected the allergen free pantry, as I had the experience of not knowing about it until a month or so into classes. This isn’t surprising, though, as I don’t believe I had informed the school of my dietary needs. What *was* surprising is that multiple people I know had documented their celiac with the school and got no notification that this measure existed, which is disappointing!
						</p>
						<p>


(I’m realizing that it may not actually be what was initially meant in this prompt - perhaps you were aiming for evidence for design with an intentional lack of information.)
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">8. Evidence of design with an absence of help</h2>
                   <p>
					<a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/4.8.1stairs.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
					<p>
						For this, we selected the lack of elevators in many of the dorms, implying that folks with certain mobility needs can’t visit friends at higher levels, nor go into common spaces, which are often not on the first floor.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">9. Evidence of design for historical specificity</h2>
                   <p>
					<a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/4.9.1chapel.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
			<p>

Usen Castle was built specifically to reference Lismore Castle, which is in ireland. This is a really clear example of appealing to historical specificity! Apparently, the founder of Middlesex University fell in love with Lismore Castle while traveling through Ireland, and wanted to replicate it at home. But, the owners wouldn’t allow him to have the blueprints. So, he commissioned drawings of the exterior of the castle, constructing ours built off of it! This is likely why the interior is a bit of a mess, and there are such random, slightly nonsensical details scattered about it.
</p>
<h2 class="section-heading">10. Evidence of design for environmental sustainability</h2>
                   <p>
					<a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/4.10.1bike.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
					<p>Here, we chose the little fixit station outside the science complex. It’s representative of a lot of the ideals of repair and sustainability that we’ve been discussing!</p>
<h2 class="section-heading">11. Evidence of design for health and well-being</h2>
                   <p>
					<a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/4.11.1blue.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
					<p>
					The first thing we picked was the blue lights. These let students make emergency calls to personnel all around campus. But.. no one ever really uses them.</p>

                   <p>
					<a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/4.11.1pads.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
					
					<p>
					Second, we took a photo of the free pad and tampon stations that rest in many of the bathrooms. I think that this is pretty self explanatory, given that folks have designed this service in favor of the accessibility of health products.</p>

</p>
<h2 class="section-heading">12. Evidence of design for intercultural community building</h2>
                   <p>
